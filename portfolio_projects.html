Working through these projects, I became familiar with vendor services such as Follet and their processing procedures, as well as electronic and government resources. Having completed this series of projects, I feel prepared to access and draw on a broad array of references when considering developing my future school library collection. Particularly, these sources are useful for both children's and teens' leisure reading, but also their reference and research needs.</td>

As an essential management skill, I found this project to be challenging in striking a balance between adequate description and too much information. I am a proponent of genrification for fiction collections, and this project helped me to formulate a more cohesive plan for how I would manage my future institution's collection.</td>

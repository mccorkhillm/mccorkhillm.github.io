<h1>Values Statements</h1>

  <h3>Reflection Statement, Fall 2019</h3>
    <h4>November 2019, LIS 60870</h4>
      <p>
	   Having completed all of my required coursework for both my M.L.I.S. and my M.Ed. degrees as well as my on-site practicum hours and Stow Munroe Falls High School, I feel well-prepared to meet the challenges of a school library media specialist and competencies outlined in the American Association of School Librarians, and the Ohio Guidelines (AASL, 2007; Ohio Department of Education, n.d.; Spear, 2018.). I feel that my theoretical foundation has been firmly set in place through the readings and projects completed for my classes, and that I was able to put theory into practice in the way I addressed my practicum (which is further detailed in my Practicum Summary). The daily tasks I took on during my time in SMFHS affirmed my belief in the fact that leadership is not simply a skillset, but also a mindset (Dickinson, 2015)—a reflection which was also laid out in my initial reflection.<br>
     <br>
     I continue to believe that collaboration and support for staff are vital to the operation of a school library and its success in meeting the needs of its users. By being exposed to school and district policies and continuing to be mindful of the Ohio Guidelines for libraries (Ohio Department of Education, n.d.), I was able to see how policies interact with the management and daily goings-on in a school library media center, and will strive in my future position to align these goals with my personal practice.<br>
     <br>
     In my approach to teaching, through newfound experience in instruction, I see the importance of employing classroom management strategies that fit the needs of the learners I am teaching. In particular, a view that has not changed is that the needs of individual students, which may include special circumstances, must be acknowledged in curriculum and instruction design and the ability of all class participants to learn in a safe and accommodating environment is paramount. My experience with technology will be integral in meeting these needs, as well as ensuring that the library is up to current standards and practices and upholding the tenets of Universal Design for Learning (Robinson, 2017). I found through my experience on-site that technology is a way to reach learners who may otherwise be reluctant, which was affirming of my stance on technology.<br>
     <br>
     One belief that I found has lessened in importance to my overall philosophy is the online presence of the librarian in a school library. I found in my on-site hours that communication via email or chat seemed to be adequate in meeting the needs of library users. However, access to online databases remains something I am dedicated to providing to students. Additionally, I see the need for increased media and information literacy instruction, and I will strive to deliver this in the future.
     <br>
     I continue to believe that the learning commons (Harper, 2013) is the ideal set-up for flexibility and collaborative capability in a school library, and so these are design aspects I hope to implement in my future institution, particularly with flexible and accessible seating arrangements that comply with ADA guidelines.<br>
     <br>
     Overall, my current view and idealogical positions on the profession remain largely unchanged from my initial philosophy statement. I believe that the greatest challenge I will face is advocacy, which I continue to see as an integral aspect of the management of a school library media center. My passions lie, particularly, in the use of technology and collection development techniques to give all students equitable access to relevant and relatable materials that they actually want to use.<br>
     <br>
     My time in my culminating experience was truly eye-opening and helped to solidify where I see the vitality of addressing the needs of all learners and library users equally and to the best of my ability.

  <h3>Philosophy Statement, Fall 2018</h3>
    <h4>November 2018, LIS 60607</h4>
      <p>
        As a school library media specialist, I will take on many roles and responsibilities which are vital to helping students meet the Standards for 21st Century Learners set forth by the American Association of School Librarians, and the Ohio Guidelines for libraries (AASL, 2007; Ohio Department of Education, n.d.; Spear, 2018.). I will: carefully plan services and events; manage the collection to include materials that appeal to all students; create a budget to address the library’s needs proactively; collaborate with teachers and members of the community; and create a strategy for advocacy and marketing that will ensure the library’s place at the forefront of the school as a dynamic space for inquiry-based learning (Lance & Kachel, 2013; AASL, 2007). As Dickinson (2015) says, leadership should be a personal mission, not a set of skills that is merely taught.<br>
        <br>
	      As a library leader, I will strive to recognize the talents and capabilities of the library’s personnel, both paraprofessionals and volunteers, and ensure they are prepared to carry out their tasks and have the tools to contribute to the success of the school (Woolls & Coatney, 2018). This will help align the library’s mission with the goals of the school district, following the Ohio Guidelines (Ohio Department of Education, n.d.). I will continually gather data to evaluate the quality of the school library’s programming and represent my findings to key stakeholders to advocate the benefits of the school library (Lance & Kachel, 2013; Schlosser, 2017; Woolls & Coatney, 2018).<br>
        <br>
	      As a teacher librarian, I will take into consideration the different learning styles and learning needs of all students. To better serve all students in a least restrictive environment, I intend to use the principles of Universal Design for Learning when developing instructional materials, taking advantage of technology to reach all students, including those with special needs, with each lesson (Robinson, 2017). I will collaborate with teachers to better understand the students’ backgrounds.  I am committed to serving students from all backgrounds and will embrace diversity, both in informing teaching practices as well as collection development (AASL, 2011).<br>
        <br>
	      To further my professional development, I will commit to active involvement in professional associations on multiple levels: the national AASL, state OELMA, and local organizations, so that I am a well-rounded professional who considers multiple perspectives and can address the rapid changes occurring in the field (Cox, 2015; Schlosser, 2017; Woolls & Coatney, 2018). I will also strive to be involved in parent-teacher organizations and administrative meetings to make contacts with different stakeholder groups (Schlosser, 2017). I will pursue continuing education by way of actively reading professional journals and attending workshops to inform evidence-based practice, following the Ohio Guideline (Ohio Department of Education, n.d.).<br>
        <br>
	      In drawing up the library budget, I will plan with foresight, creating wishlists for when any excess funds might be used to enhance the collection/facility (Harper, n.d.). I will invest in a diverse array of formats and involve stakeholders in the process (Valenza, 2010). I will make purchases that are flexible, multi-use, and can endure for years (Harper, n.d.). I will collect data on how the collection materials and library resources are used by students and teachers to inform future purchases, and to evaluate and be able to more effectively market the library’s offerings (Woolls & Coatney, 2018; Valenza, 2010).<br>
        <br>
	      I believe in pursuing multiple avenues for collaboration to take a holistic approach to meeting students’ and other stakeholders’ needs, including pairing with public libraries, vendors, and community organizations to extend the reach of the school library beyond the walls of the school and expand its services (AASL, 2007; Harper, 2014; Ray, 2013; Woolls & Coatney, 2018). I will work with teachers to develop effective strategies for co-teaching, as well as meet regularly with the principal (Lance & Kachel, 2013). Working with teachers, I will ensure that the school library program aligns with the academic content standards in the district (Ohio Department of Education, n.d.).<br>
        <br>
	      I also believe that an active virtual presence, through both a school library website and social media, is essential in order to reach out to students beyond the school walls and the timeframe of the school day (Barack, 2016; Boyer, 2016). Following the Standards and Guidelines, I will consistently seek to further equal access to information to all students and school stakeholders, by providing access to collection materials and technology to learners who may not have access in the home (AASL, 2007; Ohio Department of Education, n.d.). Recognizing that there is a digital divide, I would aim to develop programs to ensure students can utilize the library space in their own time for example, working with administration to extend hours or enable the checkout of technology, since many students may only access Internet in the home via mobile devices (Barack, 2016; Harper, 2013; Valenza, 2010).<br>
        <br>
	      I hope to organize the facility in service of making the space flexible, so that it is not just a place for quiet, individual study, but a learning commons where students can work together to develop creativity and critical thinking skills (AASL, n.d.; Harper, 2013). I also value the position of helping students become life-long readers, so it is also important to provide space and opportunities for independent reading, as well as to engage their families to encourage reading outside of the school setting (AASL, 2010). I will also take copyright compliance into consideration in planning the layout of the library, such as by placing printers/copiers within the line of sight of the librarian (Harper, 2007). Rather than being an enforcer of library rules, I will be an ally for learners and fellow educators, to help them understand topics such as copyright and intellectual freedom (Harper, 2007).<br>
        <br>
	      Ultimately, as a school library media specialist, I want to help create a library space that supports innovation and critical thinking, improves students’ literacy skills, and assists them in learning technologies that will help them become more effective 21st Century Learners (AASL, 2007; Valenza, 2010). I will endeavor to be an intuitive leader in the school library who is responsive to the needs of all students, continually learning and evaluating the school library.<br>

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
         As part of my culminating dual-degree experience, I have published this E-Portfolio as a repository showcasing my work over the course of my Masters program. Each project demonstrates core competencies falling under one of the required categories.
        </p>
        <p>
          The e-portfolio is meant to be a product that collects and displays my coursework and professional activities. As such, I have chosen to make it a project in itself demonstrating what I have learned in the Digital Technologies course series, which I completed at the end of the Fall 2019 semester. Additionally, I have employed knowledge I gained during my graduate assistantship to host the site on GitHub, so that it can persist beyond my graduation from Kent State University.

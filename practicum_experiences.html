                <td>This in-service used the same PowerPoint as the ILI session, but the presentation and survey were modified for practitioners, specifically the Fulbright Scholars visiting SMFHS, hosted through KSU. Media literacy was a required component of their program, and I was asked to adapt and conduct my news literacy session for them by the librarian, who was KSU's liaison within SMFHS. I received 3/5 anonymous responses to my feedback survey, the feedback for which was positive.</td>
